Description:

@your-scope/effect-typeorm is a TypeScript library that integrates TypeORM with Effect-TS, enabling functional, type-safe, and composable database operations. This library provides seamless interoperability between Effect-TSâ€™s Effect monad and TypeORM, ensuring proper resource management, transaction handling, and error safety in an effectful programming model.

Key Features:

	â€¢	Effect-TS Compatible: Wraps TypeORM operations in Effect for pure functional programming
	â€¢	Safe Transaction Handling: Provides transactional effects that integrate with Effect<R, E, A>
	â€¢	Dependency Injection with Layer: Enables composable and modular service architecture
	â€¢	Fully Typed API: Ensures type safety across database interactions

ðŸš€ Perfect for building scalable and functional applications using TypeORM with Effect-TS!
